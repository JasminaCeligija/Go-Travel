Istanbul is one of the truly great romantic cities, straddling the Bosphorus with its skyline studded with domes and minarets. Today it hums as Turkey's cultural heart and good-time capital. Its history tracks back from Byzantium to Constantinople to its place at the head of the Ottoman Empire." +

Side by side with Old Istanbul you'll find hip bars and clubs, flashy executives, malls and haute cuisine. " +

There is a rich arts culture, opera, music, cinema, which nods its head to the Ottoman and Byzantine ways while taking cues from Europe. " +
